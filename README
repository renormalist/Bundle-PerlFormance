Bundle-PerlFormance
===================

This bundle installs a bunch of modules that belong to
Benchmark::Perl::Formance. The main difference to the raw module
Benchmark::Perl::Formance is that there it only "recommends" modules
so it can be used flexibly for any subset of benchmarks whereas this
bundle here "requires" most of the dependencies.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

LICENCE

This module is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
