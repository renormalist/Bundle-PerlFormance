Bundle-PerlFormance
===================

This bundle defines a bunch of modules that belong to
Benchmark::Perl::Formance. The main difference to the raw module
Benchmark::Perl::Formance is that there it only "recommends" modules
so it can be used flexibly for any subset of benchmarks whereas this
bundle here "requires" most of the dependencies.

INSTALLATION
